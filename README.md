## Overview

This project is a library written in Scala for use with Ripple XRP ledger.
Main use-case is local sign and signFor implementation. See: 

Cross-compiled to Scala 2.12.9 and Scala 2.13.0 currently, tested with OpenJDK9
It takes 

1. JSON and serializes into Ripple binary format, e.g. TxBlob
2. De-serializes Ripple binary encoded â€“ back to a TxBlob style or broken down to hex fields and subfields for debugging

  
Best place to start on documentation is:
 https://developers.ripple.com/serialization.html

* Testing is done against a set of trace txn from Ripple stand-alone server, these may also be useful to someone for
 some other purpose.

## Quick Start

Published under Bintray for now, so in sbt use via:

```
   // Where version is the value in the badge above, e.g. "0.3.0" 
   resolvers in ThisBuild += Resolver.bintrayRepo("odenzooss", "maven"),
   libraryDependencies += "com.odenzo" %% "ripple-binary-codec" % version
```

The API is in   `com.odenzo.ripple.bincodec.RippleCodecAPI` and provides the routines to 

- Serializize a JsonObject (Stirng form) to non HashPrefixed
    * TxBlob  (aka serialize ll serialization fields)
    * SigningTxBlob (serialize for Signing, this is binary that is signed to TxnSignature)
    
- Serialize a Ripple address in Base58Check format, no Variable Length encoding. This 
is useful for implementing SignFor / Multi-signing.

Other API are useful but have more specific requirements, e.g. using Circe JsonObject.
The returned errors are of typer RippleCodecError which extends Throwable.
There are also some Cats "show" implicits defined in `bincodec.syntax` package.
These are likely to move to their companian objects. 

Other than that the API should be stable, additional Java, ScalaJS and perhaps Scala Native may be added.
  
    


## Differences from Ripple Signing

### Issued Amounts (aka Fiat Amount, IOU Amount)
https://xrpl.org/currency-formats.html#issued-currency-math defines the "spec" for these.

Defined with 15-digits of precision and min and max ranges.
Testing has shown that messages with more than 15 digits of precision are round/truncated.
This is unlikely to occur in most cases, but I am not comfortable with it.
All amounts with more than 15 digits of precision are rejected by the binary-encoder for now.
If I figure out the precise behaviour of RippleD may change this.
For now a hack with BigDecimal precision which treated 1234.00 as precision 6 (trailing zeros are significant digits)s 

Examples:
 - 9223372036854775807 is SignRq is returned as 9223372036854775e3 in response)
 - 18014398509481989 =>   1801439850948198e1 

Mantissa is 54 bit unsigned, everything after that seems to be truncated.

Tidy up and correct error messages pending for Issued Amounts, see IssuedAmountCodec

### 160-bit hex encoded Currencies not tested or supported


## Status

- Functional serialization, works on a good set of test cases.
- Deserialization useful for development and debugging work
- Code is getting cleaner, but not optimized. 



## TODOs

* Add more test cases, particularly of Ripple transactions  (High Priority)
* Optimize data structures perhaps (currently List[UByte] everywhere) and concatenation.
* Cross-compile to Javascript
* Maven x-publish on Version 0.4.x
* Adding Hex encoded currencies
* Rethink the Scribe approach to logging, using customer root logger
