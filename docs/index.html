<p>
    This is the project site for a Scala implementation of <a href="https://www.ripple.com/">Ripple</a> binary
    serialization. Binary serialization is the conversion of internal binary representation of Ripple Ledger messages
    and ledger data structures.
</p>
<p>
    This library is primarily focussed on the serialization of Ripple transactions into binary form for the purpose
    of localling cryptographically signing transactions. The signing cryptographic code is in another project.
